		<div class="title">Content‐out design</div>
		<div class="abstract">
			<p>Experience design is concerned with creating things that communicate with people. Things that empower, amuse, and delight. On the web, and on many other mediums, a large part of that communication occurs through the written word and its nature is shaped by our typographical treatments. Typography gives the written word a stature, a voice, a mood, and emotion. Beyond simply the choice of letterforms and fonts, typography is concerned with the interplay of typographical elements.</p>

<p>In this pragmatic session, Aral Balkan will demonstrate how typographical concerns and a content‐out approach to design shape the way he works from initial content creation to finishing touches. With pragmatic tools, techniques, and workflows, this session will show you, instead of tell you, how you too can incorporate typographical thinking into your everyday workflows and practice content‐out design.<br></p>
