		<div class="abstract">
			<p>The typographic choices we make shape our content and how it is perceived. We can use type to whisper and we can use type to shout.</p>

<p>As designers we are entrusted to decide whether the typography we craft should become invisible, or reach out and grab our audience by the scruff of the neck. Before we can make that choice, however, we need to get to know our type – its personality, its characteristics and its history. Our content, of course, should also inform our choices.</p>

<p>Whilst its tempting to think of the rich typographic landscape we now find ourselves occupying as a new and undiscovered land, it is - in fact - a land that has been comprehensively mapped before. Thanks to the possibilities web typography offers, we, as designers, can rediscover timeless design qualities, creating work which sit outside of time, whether it’s shouting or whispering.</p>
