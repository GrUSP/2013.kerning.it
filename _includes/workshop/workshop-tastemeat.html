				MEAT was born in 2004 when 5 young professionals decided to start working together. They were working in various fields: as graphic designers, illustrators and photographers – and had common roots and links in graffiti writing. Their formative backgrounds vary from psychology to fine arts and this helped MEAT developing a transversal approach to design that allows them to move freely from editorial design to fashion, from working for the cultural sector to realizing hand made commissioned mural paintings.

		<div class="title">When in typography, do as the typographers do…</div>
		<div class="abstract">
			<p><b>A letterpress and typographic composition workshop.</b></p>


<p>Each and every typographic printshop is a layering of materials, recoveries and tricks.   
Each and every typographer has his own personal way of organizing, creating and cataloguing.</p>

<p>The life of a printshop is represented by the typefaces kept in it, by the forgotten compositions that lay in its dusty corners, by old clichés and, in luckiest and rarest occasions (as in "La vecchia stamperia"), wood engravings… a history whose remains are images, pieces and broken messages, just as an archaeological site.</p>
 
<p>The workshop we are proposing here, investigates the ways traditional typography can be used in actual contemporary communication, while bringing a particular emphasis to a fundamental aspect of this practice: the act of recovery.
By recovering ancient techniques and materials, a substrate made by images emerges: a substrate that characterizes the "typographic place" both culturally and geographically.
These exact materials are where we want to start our journey from, a path that will lead to the construction of a new approach to artisanal typography.</p>

	<ul>
<li>-introduction to typography with letterpress
<li>-printing demonstration at "La Vecchia Stamperia"
