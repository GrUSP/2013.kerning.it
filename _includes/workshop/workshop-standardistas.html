			<p>This workshop, delivered in the tried and tested Standardistas' Style® will introduce the wonders rich web typography offers.
			</p>
			<p>Creating typographically rich and inspiring designs has never been easier and offers significant benefits and opportunities for a Retina ready future. In this workshop we'll introduce some fundamentals of typography, drawn from a long tradition, and explore the new visual language that rich web type now offers.
			Armed with this fundamental knowledge and an abundance of typographic tools – not to mention the Standardistas' 'Bag of Awesome™' * – we show the aspiring typographer the tricks of the trade through a series of hands-on typographic exercises.
			</p>
			<p>By the end of an intensive, but enjoyable day, participants will have acquired a wealth of typographic knowledge on which to build, ensuring that they leave inspired and ready to apply their new-found skills to create beautifully crafted web type experiences.
			</p>
			<p>* Complimentary for every workshop participant. Nice!</p>
